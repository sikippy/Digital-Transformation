This project was my personal project during my master study at Universita Degli Studi di Pavia. 
The project mainly discussed about health especially for General Practitioner roles in Italy, it is aiming to simplify the main process, reduce costs, analyze the risks, perform optimization
to reach the goal which is to be able to collaborate between government, lab, general practitioner, user and patient (current stakeholders).

I was taught by Professor Gianmario Motta (thank you Prof. Motta), who I believe that he is one of the expert Professor in my university. I heard that he had gained much experiences in project management roles.

To finish this subject, we should make a presentation in front of the Professor, and he asked us in person about the structure of the project, which was divided into 4 main parts:
- Project Structure
- Project Requirements
- Project Cost
- Project Risk

Some additional part :
- Gantt Chart
- GP flowchart

I hope these files can be useful for the study especially in digital transformation project. If you want to use these files, please state also this source as I already
gave my thought and my heart in doing this project. Thank you.
